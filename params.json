Install agni locally.\r\n\r\n2. Enter the _agni_ directory: `cd agni`.\r\n\r\n3. Run `nmp start`.\r\n\r\n4. Point your browser to `localhost:3000`.\r\n\r\n5. If you see the welcome message, it works!\r\n\r\n##Architecture\r\n\r\nAgni is loosely based on the [MVC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)\r\ndevelopment pattern.\r\n\r\nThe three main application components are:\r\n\r\n- the **Model**, which is the data access layer;\r\n\r\n- the **View**, which is the part of the application that is \"visible\" to the user;\r\n\r\n- the **Controller**, which acts as an intermediary between the other two components,\r\ntaking data from the Model and sending it to the View.\r\n\r\nA fourth component is optionally available, that is the **Service** layer.\r\nThe purpose of this layer is encapsulating business logic in a high level interface\r\navailable to the controller, freeing the latter from overload and duplication.\r\n\r\nTypically, for simple applications you will only need Controllers and Views. You\r\nare not forced to use Models and Services if you do not need them.\r\n\r\n##Controllers\r\n\r\nAgni's routing system is similar to that of popular frameworks like [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/):\r\n\r\n`mywebsite.com/module/function/arg1/arg2`\r\n\r\n1. The first URL segment is the module that should be required.\r\n\r\n1. The second segment is the function that should be called.\r\n\r\n1. The third, and any other segments, are the arguments that should be passed to the function.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, a request to `mywebsite.com/article/show/173`, will require the `article` module from the `controllers` folder, and execute the exported function `show(173)`."}
